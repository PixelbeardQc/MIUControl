# MIUControl
Command line application to send command to the MIU api

Use case: Use an external software like VoiceAttack to trigger commands and action group in MixItUp

Written in C#. Use Visual Studio to build it or download the latest release

Required, enable the develloper api in MixItUp

**Usage:**
- /CommandId="00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000": Where 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000 is the Command GUID (find your command GUID using http://localhost:8911/api/commands)
- /allargs="Any text you need to pass": Optional: this will pass text to your command




**TODO:**
- Not sure, its pretty good as is
